# Mixed Messages 
----------------

Project, I build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, **randomized** output. 

### How I do it?

+ I created one function that generates a random number
+ Also another three function that takes in the random function and with a switch case
+ The switch sentence selects a case depends of the random number and push the string into an empty array created at the beginning
+ At the end, all the three functions are called, and the message is printed 



### Technologies

1. Javascript
2. Node js

### Running the code
```
$ cd ../folder
$ node main.js
```
